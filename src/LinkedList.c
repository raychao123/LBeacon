* Project Name:
*
*      BeDIPS
*
* File Description:
*
*      This file contains the generic implementation of a double-linked-list 
*      data structure.It has functions for inserting a node to the front of the 
*      list and deleting a specific node. It can also check the length of the
*      list. Any datatype of data could be stored in this list. 
*     
*
* File Name:
*
*      LinkedList.c
*
* Abstract:
*
*      BeDIPS uses LBeacons to deliver 3D coordinates and textual
*      descriptions of their locations to users' devices. Basically, a LBeacon
*      is an inexpensive, Bluetooth Smart Ready device. The 3D coordinates and
*      location description of every LBeacon are retrieved from BeDIS
*      (Building/environment Data and Information System) and stored locally
*      during deployment and maintenance times. Once initialized, each LBeacon
*      broadcasts its coordinates and location description to Bluetooth
*      enabled user devices within its coverage area.
